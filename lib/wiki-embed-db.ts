/**
 * Weekly time-weighted holdings for two guilds.
 *
 * This chart used to plot each guild's captures against the other, week by
 * week, and that series could not say anything. Territory is conserved: what A
 * takes from B, B has to take back before it can be taken again, so over any
 * bucket the two counts differ only by the change in how many of the contested
 * squares each side ends up holding — a few dozen at most, against five-figure
 * capture volumes. Measured across the corpus the two lines ran at r ≥ 0.9958
 * on five of the six war pages: one line drawn twice. Worse, it flattered the
 * loser — the KongoBoys campaign against Profession Heaven, which ended a
 * five-year neutrality, plotted as 3,837 against 4,034, near parity.
 *
 * Holdings are the state the fighting was over, and they diverge: the same six
 * windows come out between r = -0.14 and r = -0.86, one side's gain being the
 * other's loss, which is what a war looks like.
 *
 * A square's holder is the attacker of the last exchange on it, so the series
 * is built from spans and clipped into weekly buckets. Two details matter:
 *
 * - `attacker_name = 'None'` is the release sentinel, not a guild. It ends a
 *   holding without starting one, which the `holder IN (a, b)` filter gets
 *   right for free.
 * - The feed sometimes writes a whole chain under one timestamp (X takes from
 *   Y, then Z takes from X, same second). Ordering those by time alone leaves
 *   `lead()` to break the tie arbitrarily and hands the following span — which
 *   can be a fortnight — to a guild that had already lost it. The row whose
 *   defender is another row's attacker in the same group happened second, and
 *   that resolves all but a handful: of 869 collisions in the Avicia–Sequoia
 *   window, 829 order cleanly and 40 are cycles (`None ← Avicia` beside
 *   `Avicia ← None`) that nothing in the row itself can separate. Those 40
 *   moved the drawn series by at most one territory-week, so they are left
 *   arbitrary rather than resolved by a second lookup.
